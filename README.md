# TrashReminder
Python script to notify household members to take out the trash

To use the script you must have a gmail email as the notification sender setup.
Then create a file called "Recipients.txt"
List your recipients first, each on a new line. Followed by your password and then email on new lines as well.

ex:<br/>
	<t/>blah@mms.att.net<br/>
	blah2@vtext.com<br/>
	password<br/>
	emailSender<br/>
